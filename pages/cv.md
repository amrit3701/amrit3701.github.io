<ul>
<li><a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2017/projects/6536382147198976"><b>Google Summer of Code-2017: Rebar Addon for FreeCAD</b></a> (<a href="https://github.com/amrit3701/FreeCAD-Reinforcement"><i>source code</i></a>) &mdash;  <i>Python, PySide, 2017</i><br>
Worked on a Google Summer of Code (GSoC) project with FreeCAD (an open source organisation). This project is aimed at easing up the reinforcement process in the FreeCAD. In this project, list of rebars will be provided to user under Rebar tools in the form of dropdown. Using this project user will reinforcement rebars in the building.</li><br>

<li><a href="http://sim.amritpals.com"><b>SIM (Structure Information Modeling)</b></a> (<a href="https://github.com/GreatDevelopers/Sim"><i>source code</i></a>) &mdash; <i>C++, Flex, Bison, Django, 2017</i><br>
This application intends to provide users with ability to store information of a structure and provide a full analysis of that structure. It also creates 2D drawings of building and also show 3D model of building on a web browser.
